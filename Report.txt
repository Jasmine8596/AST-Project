Real World Data Analysis

The observations for different inputs are as follows:

1. Input:
sensor1 = [("knife",1, 99), ("scissor", 2, 65), ("spoon", 3, 33), ("spoon", 4, 80), ("keys", 5, 95)]
sensor2 = [ ("keys", 5, 95), ("spoon", 4, 99),("fork", 3, 99), ("scissor", 2, 95), ("knife",1, 55)]

Output:
1. No error is thrown.
2. The output of the code is as required.

2. Input:
sensor1 = []
sensor2 = []
